This website is a digital representation of my master's thesis and the research I did while studying at London College of Fashion, MA Fashion Curation programme.

Included are the exhibition design, the objects in the exhibition and the details about those objects. I have included the texts from the exhibition, images and collection information from the museums they belong to.

My entire thesis is not repesented here. I have arranged the pages and content in a way that I hope will be easy to read and understand.
