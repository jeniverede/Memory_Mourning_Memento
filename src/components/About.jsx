                            My name is <strong>Jennifer</strong>, I&apos;m passionate about history and historical dress.
                            As a young girl growing up in Seattle, I always loved visiting museums and
                            seeing historical clothing displays. I would imagine myself wearing the garment
                            on display, wonder how it felt to wear it and how people lived in that time period.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As a teenager, I loved clothing and the self-expression it provided. In the early 80&apos;s,
                            I discovered the <strong>New Romantic movement</strong> from the UK and later the dark romantic
                            style of <strong>Gothic subculture</strong>. I especially loved how Gothic fashion combined historical references
                            in fabric and silhouette with modern fashion. When the time came for me to choose a career
                            direction, fashion was my first choice.

                        <p>
                            I completed my fashion design degree in NYC at <strong>The Fashion Institute of Technology</strong> in 1992.
                            Most of my instructors noticed the historical inspiration in my designs and encouraged me to
                            continue developing my unique style.
                            For the next 15 years, I worked as a designer in the mainstream fashion industry while trying
                            to launch my own collection. Although I didn&apos;t find a way to sustain my own collection in the
                            long term, my love and passion for historical clothing remained.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While working as <strong>fashion design instructor</strong>, I had the opportunity to take a break from teaching
                            in order to pursue a masters&apos; degree. At that time, <strong>London College of Fashion</strong> was the only university
                            with a degree in <strong>Fashion Curation</strong>. The curriculum was exactly what I was looking for and with my
                            life-long love of the UK, I was very excited about the opportunity to study what I loved in a place
                            I loved. I was thrilled when I was accepted to the program. I left for London in September of 2009.

                        <p>
                            My time in the <strong>MA Fashion Curation</strong> program was the happiest of my life so far. I spent my time learning
                            from my course directors, <strong>Amy de la Haye and Judith Clark</strong>, and the guest speakers we had. I chose the topics of my projects, visited
                            museums for research, wrote papers and designed presentations with my findings.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For our course exhibition, I designed and sewed a group of objects for the installation in the first room, combining my
                            love of craft, clothing and curation. During my studies I worked for <strong>Historical Royal Palaces, Tate
                                Britian/Modern and the Tower of London</strong>. I had access to historically significant objects and learned from professionals in
                            the museum industry.

                            After completing my master&apos;s degree my life took an unexpected turn, I moved to Germany in 2009.
                            Professionally, my career also took a different direction and I no longer work in fashion or with
                            history/heritage sites.
                            Despite my career going in a different direction, I still enjoy designing and sewing
                            custom wedding gowns and historical dress from the Victorian period, and researching mourning dress and it&apos;s
                            customs.

                            My career change into <strong>digital design</strong> has made it possible for me to design and code this website as
                            my first project as a <strong>web developer</strong>. I&apos;m so pleased to have a representation of the work I did for
                            my master&apos;s degree online for anyone who has an interest.
