                        In this room, we look at half mourning, the transition of widows out of mourning and the objects created to
                        memorialise the deceased.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The colour of this room is mauve. Mauve is the official colour of half mourning and was a welcome hint of
                        colour to the black, white and grey of mourning dress. The fashion for mauve came to its height in the
                        Victorian period due to the invention of aniline dyes in 1856. This development allowed for new variations
                        in colour, new depth of colour and better colour resilience. The synthetic base of aniline dye meant that it
                        could be quickly and easily mass-produced.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The dresses on display in the centre of the room reflect styles of half mourning over a thirty-year period
                        between 1860 and 1880. Given that mourning dress was made for a specific period in time, these dresses are
                        excellent examples of contemporary fashion. Women dressed for different parts of each day, morning,
                        afternoon and evening. These dresses represent what middle to upper class women would wear spending time at
                        home, walking in town or attending private dinner.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mourning jewellery was a very popular way of memorialising the dead. The symbol of the urn, as seen in the
                        objects, represents immortality. It is an ancient symbol of mourning, and can be seen on tombs and
                        sculptures in cemeteries throughout England. The needlepoint sampler and framed hairwork are examples of
                        common household items created by family members to remember their loved ones. The time spent completing
                        these objects could have aided the emotional process of mourning. A widow was expected to make a gradual
                        transition out of mourning despite the speed implied by the term&apos;s throwing off her widow&apos;s weedsâ€™. As you
                        leave this last room, so the widow leaves the last stage of mourning, and returns to the world.

                                    Originally the painting included the widow&apos;s new suitor entering through the doorway. Critics of the
                                    painting thought this vulgar so Redgrave painted the figure out but he kept a number of visual cues to
                                    suggest that the woman is soon to be married again, the bridal bonnet in the hat box in the foreground
                                    and a sprig of orange blossom (often worn or carried by brides) on the dressing table.

                                    This doll belonged to Letitia Clark (born 1741). She became a lady upon her marriage to London
                                    merchant David Powell in 1761.

                                    Letitia had a hobby of dressing her dolls in the prevailing fashions of her day, in some instances
                                    copying her own clothes.

                                    The Powell family continued the tradition of dressing dolls in fashionable clothing until 1902 and gifted
                                    the collection to the V&A in 1939.
