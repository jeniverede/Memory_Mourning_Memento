                        This room reflects the most severe period of first mourning, the time immediately after a loved one had died.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The colour of this room, black, is the only colour allowed for first mourning. The dull wall surface relates
                        to the texture of crape, the only fabric allowed for dress in first mourning. The mass production of crape
                        by Courtald&apos;s in London in the mid-1840s made it affordable for the middle and lower classNamees for the first
                        time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Silhouettes of mourning dress continually changed with fashion. For women, going into mourning was a
                        drastic, sudden change requiring a completely different wardrobe. The widow&apos;s peak cap, in contrast,
                        retained the same essential shape as its creation in the medieval period.
                        Why didn&apos;t the cap change with fashion? By the 19th century, men&apos;s dress had become almost exclusively
                        black, and the transition into mourning was complete with the addition of a black arm or hat band.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In Victorian England (1837-1901), going into mourning upon the death of a loved one was an expectation
                        of polite society. Mourning dress was the public face of a family&apos;s private grief. Wealth, social
                        position and moral principles were represented in mourning dress. Despite this, it was men who mourned in
                        public,
                        while women mourned in private. Women did not attend funeral processions, or funeral and burial services
                        at the cemetery. It was believed women were too emotionally fragile to witness the actual rituals of
                        death.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Time spent in mourning could be extensive, especially for those with a large, extended family. Stages of
                        mourning ranged from weeks, to months, to years. Widows were subject to the longest period of mourning, two
                        and a half years. Some widows, like Queen Victoria, remained in mourning till their death. Once first
                        mourning began, widows could not entertain or socialize outside their own home. In this period of isolation,
                        the widow represented the deceased, removed from the world and confined to a box.

                                    The writer of the letter is in deep mourning for the recent death of a spouse and describes their
                                    unhappiness and solitary way of life in Baden, Germany.

                                    Jet is the fossilised remains of driftwood found in Whitby, Yorkshire, England.
                                    Jet became very popular in the Victorian period and was used exclusively for
                                    mourning jewellery.
