                            The design of this exhibition reflects installation in Leipzig, Germany at Wave Gothic Treffen. The main social hub of the festival is in city center of Leipzig, at Moritzbastei.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once a greater part of the city&apos;s 16th century fortifications, the medieval styled building has been conserved and restored to give Leipzig a center for music, drama, art, academic and cultural events. I have chosen to illustrate the exhibition here due the highest population of attendees to the festival.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The building is built entirely of stone and is mostly constructed below ground, the street level is the roof. The main access to the building is by two steep flights of stairs <strong>(Plate 1)</strong>. Moritzbastei feels cavernous, with winding staircases and paths throughout. All the ceilings and entryways to the rooms, or vaults, have curved, arched ceilings. Table and seating fixtures are wood with light fixtures of wrought iron, adding to the medieval aesthetic and atmosphere of the building.

                            The room used for the exhibition installation is on the bottom, main floor of the building <strong>(Plate 2)</strong>. It is approximately 24.38 meters long and 12.19 meters wide and is regularly used for live shows and dancing. The room has two arched entrances at each side. Visitors walk through the cafe area, into a bar area, and on into the exhibition room. The exhibition room is used for music performances and has a temporary stage and lighting installed at the far back wall. These are dismantled to provide extra space for the exhibition.

                            The exhibition is traveling to the UK, Europe and the United States to a series of gothic-industrial music festivals. There are three leading festivals each year, one in England, one in Germany and one in North America. The focus of each festival is music and live performances. The secondary appeals include eating and drinking local food, social interaction and shopping. There are opportunities for art and performance exhibitions to take place in the various locations available, but as yet a museum exhibition on mourning dress has not been held during any of the festivals.

                            Whitby Gothic Weekend happens in Whitby, United Kingdom each year in April and October. The festival has been running since 1993 and is attended by one to two thousand people each year. Whitby was made famous when English 19th century novelist, Bram Stoker, set part of his story, Dracula, there and thus making it a destination for those involved in gothic subculture. Whitby was central to Victorian mourning practice due it being the source of jet, found in its landscape. Jet jewellery was the most popular jewellery worn for mourning.

                        <p>
                            Wave Gothic Treffen began after the re-unification of Germany in 1992 and happens in Leipzig, previously East Germany, yearly in May. It is the biggest gothic-industrial festival in the world and attracts twenty to twenty-five thousand visitors from around the world each year.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Convergence is another gothic-industrial festival held yearly in a different North American city. Since 1992, one to fifteen thousand people have traveled throughout North America to attend. In 2009, Convergence was held in Salt Lake City, Utah. Previous cities have included New York City, Montreal, New Orleans Toronto and Seattle.

                        <p>
                            Gothic subculture is primarily based on aesthetics of art, music and dress. They are interested in aspects of human experience that are generally seen as negative in mainstream society, darkness, sadness, and decay. These experiences are found in the Romantic and gothic novels of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that influence the subculture through romantic emotion, creativity and mystery of the supernatural, including spiritualism and the occult. A large number of Goths draw their taste in fashion directly from the Victorian period and mourning dress <strong>(Plate 3 and 4)</strong>, since it embodies a human emotional experience and is highly elaborate and decorative. By reaching into history for inspiration rather than following popular culture, Goths express the desire to be highly creative in their style of dress. An exhibition of mourning dress is of great interest to a large percentage of attendees and a direct reflection of the interests of the wider subculture.

                        <p>
                            This exhibition has been designed to create an atmosphere of mourning, with the environment of the rooms as important as the objects in each room. The exhibition is not meant to be a chronological history of mourning; the dresses and objects are not shown in chronological order but are grouped in rooms by the stage of mourning they represent. Garments and objects are restricted to the period roughly corresponding to Queen Victoria&apos;s reign.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The garments chosen for the exhibition represent an individual expression of mourning; the women who wore the garments chose the fabric, colour and design according to the expectation of tradition and to their own sense of personal style. Since, like wedding gowns, mourning dress was worn for a specific time and occasion; it can be seen as a modest representation of contemporary fashion trends. In this latter sense, all the dresses represent singularity but also a general popularity of materials, silhouette and colour that were current for the time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the entrance to the exhibition space, a small freestanding wall is installed on the left side and provides a place for the exhibition introduction panel and informational leaflets on the history of mourning dress and custom<strong>(Plate 5)</strong>. The leaflets are provided to give visitors general background information on the history of mourning. This leaflet is included in the accompanying portfolio. There are three self-contained rooms that make up the three sub themes of the exhibition, Mourning, Memory and Memento. The exterior of each room is painted a different colour reflecting the three stages of mourning.

                            As the visitor approaches each of the rooms they see a door. Original Victorian doors ware installed; each room has one door <strong>(Plate 6)</strong>. Visitors enter and leave by the same door. The door to each room symbolises the act of entering and leaving the three stages of mourning. Visitors are unconsciously aware of leaving a public space and entering a private one. Visitors move from room to room in same sequence of moving through mourning. Each room becomes progressively larger and more colourful to symbolise a widow passing back into a public, social role.
                            There is no sound in Room 1, the use of directional speakers in Room 2 and 3 provide a background soundtrack.

Introduction panels reflecting the theme of the room are on the wall to the left as the visitor enters the room. Since dress is the focus of the exhibition, each room has one to three garments mounted on museum standard mannequins and on a square plinth in the center of the room <strong>(Plate 7)</strong>. There are no barriers between the garments and the visitors. Text is printed on the plinth, requesting visitors to not touch the garments. Inside each room to the right of the door is a seated room attendant to ensure security and safety of the garments and objects on display.

                            The path through each room is similar, a circular path to the left. Certain aspects of each room are common, such as temperature, flooring and lighting <strong>(Plate 9 & 10)</strong>. Lighting is set at museum standard 50 lux, and is installed on a track system to provide spotlighting on the objects. There is no general overhead lighting. Cases have internal lighting fixtures in order to prevent glare.

                            Temperature is not controlled, but remain at the ambient temperature of the room. Given that the room is underground and built of brick, the space tends to be cool or cold, depending on the weather. The humidity of the space could be a concern in relation to the conservation of the garments and objects, and should be analysed at the beginning of the installation process before garments are introduced to the space. It is required that this analysis be be carried out at each site, with proper alterations taking place to create a museum standard climate for the exhibition.
